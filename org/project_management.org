* [#C] Update template <<Update template>> [0%]

** TODO Specify the way to cite the project in the `CITATION` file. 
 This will likely need updating over the course of the project.
- [ ] Update in `analysis/license.Rmd` too

** TODO Check that the `LICENSE` file is appropriate.
 Unless there is good reason to prefer something different, we strongly prefer
 open, permissive licenses to make our work as widely accessible and useable as
 possible.
- [ ] Update in `analysis/license.Rmd` too


* [#B] Make project reproducible <<Reproducibility>>

** TODO Rewrite `Snakefile` file that defines the Snakemake workflow
The included file in this template provides a useful starting point and some
handy patterns to exploit.
